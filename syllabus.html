          <h3>Course Catalog Description</h3>
          <p>
            Students in this course will learn the importance of 
            human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The 
            course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as 
            usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use 
            design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site 
            engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and 
            construction of user-centered Web sites.

          <h3>Course Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This course favors a mobile-first approach to web design and development, with special attention to the 
            challenges of designing touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping 
            and rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design principles the 
            course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography, and responsive grid-based page 
            layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies 
            and polyfills will be treated as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around 
            projects of varying size and scale, emphasizing the course's hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web design 
            and development.
