# Project2

I have learned that making a responsible website isn't an easy job! My group members have taught me a lot and Javascript still my weak point. However, writing HTML and CSS is not that hard for me if compared with the beginning of the semester. I will definitely learn more Javascript in the future and I want to add more js functions in the future personal website just make it more interactive with the users who see my page. Through this class, I learned more human interaction and how people feel and think when they see the certain icons on the internet. Â
